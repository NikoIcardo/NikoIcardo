**A bit about myself:**

I'm a passionate engineer who enjoys solving larger structural issues and problems in applications from designing data pipelines and repositories like redux structures and REST API structures to diagnosing latency issues within those architectures and optimizing them to make them more efficient. I enjoy challenging tasks and feature integrations making large contributions and even building full applications on my own. I am not driven by mediocrity and would not be happy building a fancy button for a week. Rather, I would like to build a button framework to implement diverse button functionality for large integration throughout an entire set of applications and use-cases. 

I have a strong eye for detail. Give me thirty lines of code and I'll find twenty things to improve. Give me a bug that you haven't been able to solve and I'll pour hours into investigating it ensuring I understand where the issue is and resolving it before I can rest. I like projects that hand me large responsibility and allow me room to grow my engineering abilities. I never back down from a challenge and also work well with teams utilizing team knowledge and contributing my own to enhance teams' efficiencies. I believe, in the humblest of ways, that I am a rare engineer having drive and capability not usually found at my experience level.

Despite this recognition of my own ability, I enjoy recognizing talent in others as well and helping them learn how to apply their strengths and fortify where they have difficulty. Taking on a teaching role is something I take great pleasure in, but I also enjoy listening to constructive criticism and learning from others too, never being afraid to grow. My ultimate goal in engineering is to learn, challenge myself, and accomplish great things and I think that starts with humility and dedication.  

If you think you have a project I'd be able to contribute to please do not hesitate to let me know. I would love to hear about it.
